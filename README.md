It's an improv heavy, very light RPG that only requires a group of silly people, a pile of small objects, a single six-sided die, and an hour or two to play.

## Quick Summary
Players take turns controlling an imaginary person and creating a story (in real time) that leads to the accomplishment of goals that each player arbitrarily comes up with at the start of the game. When a player loses control of the person, the other players can take the story in a new direction as they try to accomplish their own goals. These goals are usually secret until they are achieved. 

One player acts as the host, and does not compete with the others. Instead, they are the main author of the story, mediator, and the one responsible for creating some kind of coherent narrative. 

Players start with points which they use as currency to buy "possession" of the person, and the game ends when all players have run out of possession points. Players also start with "skills" at the beginning of the game that will help them accomplish their personal goals. Success on actions along the way relies on rolling the die.

There is no board, no pieces, and barely any rules.  Don't overthink it. Come up with something fun to accomplish, and some silly skills that will help you do it. 



### Requirements

- 2-6 Players acting as spirits
- 1 Player acting as the Narrator
- A pile of small items that can easily fit in the palm of someone's hand. Paper clips, marbles, beans, pennies, etc. At least 10 per spirit
- At least 1 regular six-sided die, like the ones used in Craps or Yahtzee. If possible, one d6 per spirit
  
###  Story
A group of spirits have figured out how to enter the physical world, but they aren't especially good at it. Instead of appearing in their true forms, they've completed a ritual to create an empty husk of a person to serve as a **host body** for them to possess.

The spirits have all sworn an **oath** to the Beyond to complete a task of their own choosing using the host body as an empty vessel. 

But **possession** is hard.  Only one spirit can take possession while the others sit back helplessly watching the body get into trouble.  On top of that, it's comedically easy to break the link and make the body stand empty until the spirits figure out who's up next.

Each possession drains the spirits' possession power, and the body will melt back into a puddle of ectoplasm once all of the spirits' possession power is drained.

Whenever a spirit completes an oath, the Beyond will bestow favor upon them. Not all oaths are created equally, and spirits will be rewarded with additional favor when completing more ambitious oaths. Each spirit possesses a unique set of skills to help them make the most of their possessions and fullfill their oaths. 

The spirit that has earned the most favor when all spirits are out of possession power is the winner!

## Rules


### Overarching Rules

#### Moderation
These guidelines encourage loose rules and debating what is and is not allowed/possible, but the Narrator's final word is law.

The Narrator can veto any player's actions at their discretion based on game-mechanics or content moderation. We're underworld beings, but let's not make anyone uncomfortable.

#### Follow [Improv Guidelines](https://web.archive.org/web/20231128093304/https://kicp-workshops.uchicago.edu/eo2014/pdf/Tina-Feys-rules-of-improv.pdf)
- "Yes, and..."
- Avoid asking questions unless supplying more information
- Provide colorful detail

#### Discretion
The game's rules are meant to be loose. If any ridiculous and unbelievable action or a result is fun and all players are okay with it, it can be legal.


### Setup

#### Spirit Setup
Before the Narrator begins the story, each Spirit arbitarily creates three items:

1. A name for their spirit
2. The oath they must complete to gain favor.
3. Two skills that will assist them in fulfilling their oaths. Optionally, Spirits can give themselves three skills, but opting to do so will cause them to start with 7 possession points instead of 10.

Spirit names and skills are shown to all players, but oaths should be kept secret until they are fulfilled. Write skills and names down and keep them visible.

Next, the Narrator gives each Spirit 10 possession points. 

#### Oaths
Each Spirit secretly comes up with a task they will try to get the possessed host to complete. The player that earns the most favor by fulfilling their oaths wins. 

At the start of the game, the Narrator will judge the difficulty of the oath and award it a level of 1, 2 or 3. Level 1 oaths are not very ambitious and are worth the fewest favor points, while Level 3 oaths are challenging but rewarding. A Level 1 oath might be to _eat a hot dog_, while a Level 3 oath might be to _get a hot dog elected president._

It is up to the Narrator to decide when a Spirit's oath has been fulfilled. The Spirit may plead their case if there is some doubt, however.

Since all players control the same host body, it is possible that a player's oath will be fulfilled even when they are not in possession. In that case, _only the player that swore the oath will earn favor, not the player that was in possession of the body when it took the action to fulfill the oath._

When a Spirit intentionally fulfills their own oath, they lose possession. If one spirit fulfills another spirit's oath, they do not lose possession.

For ideas on oaths, see the **Oath Examples** below.

##### Oath Guidelines
It is up to the narrator to keep prevent the players from abusing the wording, interpretation, or content of their oaths to an "unfair advantage." If a Spirit's oath is to _eat a hot dog_, the narrator will need to describe reasons why the player cannot just eat 5 hot dogs at once, or eat a hot dog every possession. 

Oaths must be entirely in the universe of the game. A Spirit's oath cannot be, for example,  to _annoy the Narrator_. Nor can it be something too meta, like having an oath to lose possession at least once. Enforcement  is up to the discretion of the Narrator.


#### Skills
At setup, Spirits arbitrarily create "skills" with a short description that will help them fulfill their oath and make it easier to win dicerolls. Players must choose two skills, but can opt to choose 3 skills. Players that opt for three skills start with only 7 possession power.

Skills should be simple and not too strict. For example:
- Karate
- Singing
- Able to stomach 15 hot dogs
- Magic
- Handwriting
- A childlike sense of wonder
- Knitting

While all players control the same host, skills are _not shared_ between players unless the players choose the same skill.

#### Spirit Personalities

Spirit personalities can be as undefined or structured as players like them to be. Spirits can be a completely blank slate with random skills, or a fully developed character.
If someone wants to be the spirit of Elvis, they might have the skills of singing and dancing. They might also talk like Elvis for the whole game.


## Possession
### Gaining Possession

To gain possession of the host, spirits bid using possession points. They place a select number of tokens in their hand, place the hand on the table, and then reveal their bid to all others. The player with the highest number wins possession and that many points is deducted from their possession power. In the event of a tie for highest bid, players keep bidding until there is a clear winner. Players that lose a bid do not lose any possession points. 

When a posssession ends, the previously player is allowed to bid again immediately.

Repossession bidding happens _before_ the Narrator explains what events transpired since possession was lost. After the start of a new possession, the narrator advances the situation a reasonable amount. If a player loses possession because they failed to dodge a pie flying at their face, the new possession might begin with the host getting hit with it.

Players are not required to bid, but if no players do, all players roll the die. The player that rolls the highest number takes possession. On the new possession, the Narrator will advance the story in a way that will encourage the players to get back into it.

### Losing Possession
Spirits lose possession upon
- Losing an action roll
- Fulfilling their own oath
- Leaving the table for any reason (Narrator's discretion)

#### Idle Rolls
The Spirit's hold on the host body is weak and requires constant stimulation. If the Spirit takes an action that would cause the body to sit idle for "a long time" (such as sleeping, reading a book, or sitting quietly on a bus), it will fall into a charging state and they will lose possession.  To prevent this, the spirit must win an "Idle roll" to ensure that the body doesn't slip away from them.

To win an idle roll, a Spirit must roll a 4 or higher. If they roll 3 or lower, they lose possession. As in action rolls, spirits may spend possession points to add to their rolled score on a 1:1 basis.
 
After repossession caused by the loss of an idle roll, _all_ players gain 1 possession point as the body has recharged.

### Writer's Block
If a player does not have any ideas to move the story forward, the narrator can end their possession, and open bids for repossession. The Narrator should give the possessing player a warning about idleness as needed. 

After losing possession because of writer's block, a spirit is allowed to bid immediately - but they better have a good idea this time or they lose possession again.

---
## Play


After the initial possession bid, the narrator describes the start of the story with only as much detail as they would like. Before this, spirits (and often the Narrator) have no knowledge of the world outside of their own oaths and the skills of other Spirits. The host body can wake up anywhere, and it is up to the Spirits to ask the Narrator to paint the scene for them. Based on improvisation between the possessing spirit and the Narrator, players build the world, characters, and in real time as they aim to achieve their goals. Make it silly and fun.



### Interacting with the World
It's up to the Spirits and the Narrator to build the world through improvisation. To construct the situation, try add to or twist ideas rather than blocking or replacing them. This way, the players can construct the details they need to fullfill their oaths. 

For example, if a Spirit's goal is to eat a hot dog, they would need to figure out where the nearest hot dogs are, get themselves there, and figure out how to aquire them. All actions have consequences, so if you steal the hot dogs you may find yourself locked up in a jail where no hot dogs are allowed. The narrator should make it possible for every Spirit to complete their oaths by adding little hints here and there about a detail relevant to the oaths - even if the oaths of the players not currently in possession.

For example, if an NPC asks a player "Are you the hot dog guy?" The player should never respond with "No" but instead with something that incorporates the question while adding new information to the world/scene. If the Spirit's goal is to eat as many hot dogs as possible, they might answer "Yeah, you can just set them all down here..." 


### Action Rolls

When a spirit wants to take that they could reasonably (or unreasonably, per the Narrator's discretionn) fail at, the Narrator will require that they roll the die. The outcome of this roll will determine if they succeed or fail.
If the Spirit has a skill that is "relevant" to the action, their odds are better. 

-  If the Spirit has no "relevant" skill, they must roll a 5 or 6 to win. (2/6 Chance to win)
-  If the Spirit has a relevant skill, rolling 3 or higher wins. (4/6 Chance to win)

For example, if a spirit wants to __persuade__ someone to let them into an office building, their odds would be better if they had skills like "persuasion" or "professionalism," but not "trombone" or "karate." If a player had the trombone skill, they should invent some trombone-centric method of getting what they want instead of trying to talk their way into things.

Spirits should utilize their skills, but understand that using karate to get into an office building by force may have more serious consequences than talking their way in. In either case, the consequences are at the discretion of the Narrator.

If a Spirit wins a roll, they describe what their success looks like in an amusing manner. 
If a Spirit loses a roll, the Narrator describes how amusingly badly their failed at their action. 
In either case, other players can contribute suggestions if they are fun.

**Before** a roll, a Spirit can add to their rolled score by spending possession power on a 1:1 basis. They deduct the number of points from their possession power pool, then roll the die and add the roll value to the number of points deducted to get their final score. By doing this, it is possible to win the roll ahead of time. By spending 5 points (and thereby losing 1/2 of the possession power they started with!) a player can guarantee a roll wins.
For example:
  - If a spirit stacks the roll with 2 points and then rolls a 2, their rolled value is now 4.
  - If a spirit stacks the roll with 2 points and then rolls a 4, their rolled value is now 6.
  - If a spirit stacks the roll with 5 points, their roll is automatically a 6. They get no bonus for scoring points higher than 6.


*Failing an action roll at any time loses possession.*

### Story Rolls

To help with the creation of the story the narrator may , at their discretion, perform "story" rolls to add some chance elements to situation's development.

For example, if a Spirit has taken the host into a wooded area and asks if there are any squirrels visible, the Narrator can either give a simple yes/no or make a story roll based on something reasonable but fun and arbitrary. They can create, on the fly, a scale of squirrels from 1 to 6, with 1 meaning Squirrels are Illegal in the area, and 6 meaning that it turns out the area is not wooded at all - instead everything visible is made of live squirrels posing into shapes!

### Keeping the Host Body Alive

Don't kill the host. If a Spirit takes an action that would somehow kill the host, it's up to the Narrator to somehow keep them alive though story powers alone.

For example, if a Sprit tries to quickly jump across the tracks before an oncoming train and then rolls a 1, the narrator might inform everyone that actually they slipped on a banana peel before the jump even started which is why it failed so badly.

However, if a Spirit tries to take an action that could have lethal consequences and fails the action, they are not allowed to participate in the next repossession bid.


### Host Body Guidelines
As a newly created body, the host's properties start as a blank slate. Spirits and the Narrator should create the description of the body as the story unfolds. For most things, the properties of the host are undefined until the Narrator makes something "canon." There are a few exceptions:
- The host is over 18 (how much over 18 unfolds as needed)
- Unless explicitly defined, the host body is unremarkable in every way.
- At the start, the host has no notable health issues (other than those that might come naturally with being their age, but nothing like deathly allergies). Injuries may arise during the game, and their impact on the game is at the discretion (whim) of the Narrator.
- Until explicitly defined, the host has no objects on their person - though this is up to the discretion of the Narrator


## Game End
When only one Spirit has more than 0 possession points remaining, they regain possession automatically at the cost of 1 point until they lose control with 0 points left.
When all players have exhausted their possession points, the game ends. 

Tally up every time a player fulfilled their oath, and multiply it by the difficulty level. If a Spirit fulfilled their level 1 oath 3 times, they earn the same number of favor points as a Spirit who completed their level 3 oath once.
The player with the highest number of favor points wins!

In the event of a tie for first place, each tied player gets one possession to complete an oath of the Narrator's choosing. The story resumes in the same place that the last possession ended.
Repeat this proccess until there is a clear winner.
